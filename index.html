						<strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a
						pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a
						tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over
						medium heat and add butter or oil.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and
						bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
						coat the surface.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set
						at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle
						your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook,
						carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook
						for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper
						if needed.
